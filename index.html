            <h2>What Is Photography?</h2>
            <p>
                Photography is a way of freezing moments in time by using a camera.
                People use it to remember special days, share stories, and show how
                they see the world. You don't need an expensive camera to start - a
                basic smartphone is enough to capture everyday life, friends, family,
                or anything that catches your eye.

            <h2>Getting Started with Photography</h2>
            <p>
                To start with photography, you don't need expensive equipment. 
                Begin with a basic camera or even your smartphone. Learn about 
                composition, lighting, and angles. Practice regularly and 
                experiment with different styles to find what you enjoy the most.
            </p>
            <P>Here are a few beginner friendly tips that helped me:</P>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the rule of thirds for better composition.</li>
                <li>Use natural light whenever possible.</li>
                <li>Keep your lens clean for clearer shots.</li>
                <li>Experiment with different perspectives and angles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Remember, photography is about having fun and expressing yourself, 
                so don't be afraid to make mistakes and learn from them!
