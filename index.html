            <h2>What Is Photography?</h2>
            <p>
                Photography is the art of capturing meaningful moments using a camera. 
                It allows people to preserve memories, express creativity, and view 
                the world through a different perspective. Whether done with a smartphone 
                or a professional camera, photography helps tell stories and share 
                emotions visually.

            <h2>Getting Started with Photography</h2>
            <p>
                To start with photography, you don't need expensive equipment. 
                Begin with a basic camera or even your smartphone. Learn about 
                composition, lighting, and angles. Practice regularly and 
                experiment with different styles to find what you enjoy the most.
            </p>
            <P>Here are a few beginner friendly tips that helped me:</P>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the rule of thirds for better composition.</li>
                <li>Use natural light whenever possible.</li>
                <li>Keep your lens clean for clearer shots.</li>
                <li>Experiment with different perspectives and angles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Remember, photography is about having fun and expressing yourself, 
                so don't be afraid to make mistakes and learn from them!
